                            It allows the royal ladies who at the time strictly observed “pardah”, to be able to watch any processions and activities on the street without being seen by the public.

The magnificent Amer Fort is an extensive palace complex that has been built with pale yellow and pink sandstone, and with white marble. The fort is divided into four main sections that are graced with their own courtyards.
                            The essence of Amer Fort is encapsulated by the beautiful light and sound show within the fort, where visitors get to see an astounding spectacle about the history of the fort.

                        <p>The building of Albert Hall Museum was built in 1876 as a concert hall. The museum gets its name from the Victoria and Albert Museum of London, because of the similarity of architecture. The foundation for the building started in 1876, when Prince of Wales visited Jaipur. When the building was constructed, the royals and government did not have any idea about usage of the building. It was initially used as Town Hall in 1880. Later, the King of Jaipur, Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II suggested to use it as a museum for Industrial Arts. Later, the hall was used for displaying masterpieces of local artisans.</p>

                        <p>Think Rajasthan and you have majestic forts and palaces coming into your mind. Nahargarh Fort is one such majestic and magnificent fort, situated in the Aravalli mountain ranges in Jaipur. 
                            Nahargarh means ‘abode of tigers’ and was named so after the tigers which were believed to have roamed around the hills. 
                            There are many structures within the fort – a temple dedicated to deity of Jaipur monarchs, another temple dedicated to Prince Nahar Singh Bhomia, a 2-storey building known as Madhavendra Bhavan named after Sawai Madho Singh who built it and Diwan-I-Aam, an open enclosure where the kings used to meet common public to hear out their grievances.

The observatories, or "Jantar Mantars" as they are commonly known, incorporate multiple buildings of unique form, each with a specialized function for astronomical measurement. These structures with their striking combinations of geometric forms at large scale have captivated the attention of architects, artists, and art historians world wide, yet remain largely unknown to the general public.</p>
